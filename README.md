# Requirements

Given this endpoint
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=100000&offset=0

Fetch this data and display the data in a table on the UI.

Focus on functionality first and add styling later. 
Bonus points for better styling and code organization.

## How to run it?

You can run it locally. 
- Install the dependencies: `npm i` 
- Run the app: `npm run dev`.

You can also run on the server using [this link](https://copilot-t.vercel.app).
